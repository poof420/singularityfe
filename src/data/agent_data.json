The walls are lined with rows of filing cabinets that seem to stretch on forever, but when I glance at them from the side, they appear to be only about a foot wide. In front of me, a small desk is cluttered with dusty papers and a metal box with the words \"Confidential Index\" etched onto its lid, next to a half-eaten sandwich wrapped in cellophane. The hiss in my teeth seems to be shifting into a low-frequency vibration that resonates in my bones.",
        "As I step forward, the fluorescent lights above me seem to flicker in sync with the low-frequency vibration still resonating in my bones. The dusty papers on the desk are scattered and worn, with handwritten notes and scribbled diagrams that don't appear to make any sense. Next to the metal box labeled \"Confidential Index,\" a pencil is standing upright on its tip, motionless, despite the hum of the fluorescent lights causing a faint air current that should be disturbing it. The sound of my own heartbeat seems to linger in my ears, as if it's coming from somewhere outside my body."

My heartbeat still echoes in my ears, like it's a sound coming from just out of sight, and the low-frequency vibration in my bones seems to be growing slightly louder, a steady, unshakeable hum."
